--------  Forecasting 1.0
------------------------------------------

An Implementation of a machine learning approach using sklearn, Recurrent and Gated
Recurrent Unit(from Deep Learning)..

The General idea is to be able to predict important features available from stock data.
For this purpose only a few of the codes ar available at this point for the client or general
public.
However, the working idea as implemented is still under construction and undergoing some
ridiculously time consuming testing.

In the End the system would adopt a method that would predict both the market 
closing price, Open_High_Low_Close(OHLC) Fibonacci pivot points and also  forecast the 
futures numbers for this parameters.

In addition we are developing a strategy to trade the market, a bot for backtesting,
and a forcaster.
